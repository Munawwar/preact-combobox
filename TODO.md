Nice to have
- When field is disabled, there is no way to see what values were selected. Though native select also works this way
- Option level disabling
- Improve performance (some work has already been done, but not measured enough)
- Mobile tray option - for better UX

Questions
- Add "remove all" button again? Optional?
  - Future proof: How will this work with native customizable selects that is being shipped by browsers?
  - Virtualization? Will cause more a11y issues?
- Package this as a web component? (cant do this properly, render functions cannot be supported)
