Priorities
- Make dark theme pass APCA contrast checker
- Docs
- Mobile tray option - for better UX

Nice to have
- When field is disabled, there is no way to see what values were selected. Though native select also works this way
- Option level disabling
- Improve performance (some work has already been done, but not measured enough)

Questions
- Add "remove all" button again? Optional?
  - Future proof: How will this work with native customizable selects that is being shipped by browsers?
  - Also optional feature? Virtualization will cause more a11y issues?
- Package this as a web component?
