Priorities
- Internationalization, RTL support
- Default Dark theme
- Docs

Nice to have
- Option level disabling
- Specialized mobile design - full width, bottom aligned popup
- Improve performance (some work has already been done, but not measured enough)

Questions
- Add "remove all" button again? Optional?
  - Future proof: How will this work with native customizable selects that is being shipped by browsers?
  - Also optional feature? Virtualization will cause more a11y issues?
- Package this as a web component?
